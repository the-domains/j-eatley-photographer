Trying out life on the Grid.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/776584d5-9f51-4d55-b0f0-8ec21acab699.jpg)

I am Jeffrey Eatley, a self taught photographer that began in film in 1996\. I restarted my love of photography in 2009 with the purchase of a Nikon D90, my first digital SLR camera. Since then I have learned, researched and practice my hobby while hoping and dreaming of the day I can take it to the limit.  Full time photography is my goal.  Most say that the only way to make it in this career is to specialize.  That is hard for me since I have found myself shooting so many different things for many different clients. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/788734ad-c1cb-466b-9a8c-5f8e13bcaf6d.jpg)

I have a love affair with my camera creating images that are in my head.   I take great privilege of coming up with a idea and then figuring out how to create it in a camera.  I am up for the challenge that is photography. My next post we can walk through all the things I have photographed. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8c453444-a700-4dd3-8250-bbb3c70566f7.png)
