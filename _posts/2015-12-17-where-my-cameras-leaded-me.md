# Where my Cameras Leaded me.

A Photographic Journey into the last five years of my life that have brought me to this moment. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ce1116a1-5e8f-4481-8052-e91f3bfe644b.png)

I began years ago with deciding the simple thing of what I would want to call a business.  I created a simple logo that my parents called my butterfly. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a4c5a07b-c791-4936-a702-f1cffd05f827.jpg)

My first night and lightning images. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8bc42f32-8f97-4006-a13b-090061b86818.jpg)

Storm chasing and Lightning were one of my first reasons to buy a Digital Camera.   My point and shoot was troublesome with the slow shutter speed and many other complications.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5025efd7-67db-4585-b359-1ace6d1a047f.jpg)

Cars were another reason I bought my first camera.  With as many shows that I attend, I wanted something to better document my travels. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2d355e57-0a21-4240-9dbc-4470b4f4ede2.jpg)

I always love to learn so it was not long after that I bought my first on and off camera flash to add lighting to my journey.  Alot changed after that. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ec9d2cb6-458d-46c0-a104-a2c399845305.jpg)

When I find a subject that I am interested in I can not help but shoot.

Cars became my love as I explored more and more possibilities with a camera.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/47655436-70f4-4d3e-a048-3c5cfb554340.jpg)

As I created more images of cars I had the opportunity to work with some incredible people at Rat Rod Magazine and some others.  Being published was a huge accomplishment in my life.  Now with multiple covers, features and write ups, I am a proud photographer. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/98da8084-8d21-4da4-a1d3-a89028db06a6.jpg)

I have also had the great pleasure of creating some very fun portraits over the years.  Families, kids, seniors, weddings and other forms that have brought many smiles and laughs. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/33ca5c57-b248-4fc5-87f6-42231d46cd8e.jpg)

We take trips in our RV for family vacations and this lead to an opportunity to become a photo blogger for GoRving.com. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b1522bbe-04ad-40ec-9330-b1efda454b4f.jpg)
